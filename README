i spend quite a lot of time reading, editing, and translating EDIFACT messages.  so i have produced this to help me work out where i am in the file.

the EDIFACT position dscription
SG2.PNA.C816.3836
isnt that helpful without a spec for reference.  the first two parts (segment group 2, segment PNA) are quite clear, but the last two arent very useful.

for an example segment
PNA+PAT+NHS_NUM1:OPI+++SU:SURNAME1+FO:FORENAME1A+TI:TITLE1+MI:FORENAME1B+FS:FORENAME1C'

that is the fragment "SURNAME1"

so instead i use numbers for the element and fragment positions, both numbered from zero.  "PNA" is element zero, "PAT" element one, etc.

using this function, place your cursor in the "SURNAME1" fragment, and it will return the info:
element = 5 , fragment = 1

when using this, make sure that every segment starts on a new line in your file (search for ' and replace with '\r will do this nicely).  trying to read EDIFACT when it is all one line is just to painful, so i dont recorment it.

this function has the seperators "+" and ":" hard coded at the moment, and doesnt handle escaped seperators.
